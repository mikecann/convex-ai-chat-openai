# AI Chat using OpenAI's Assistants API

An example of using OpenAI's
[Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) to build
an AI chat with context retrieval.

## Overview:

This app demonstrates how you can add a chat bot to an existing website, powered
by Convex and OpenAI's Assistants API.

- The chat is trigged by a button in [`App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx)
- The chat frontend is all in [`src/aiChat`](./src/aiChat/index.tsx)
- An example of web scraping is in [`convex/ingest`](./convex/ingest/load.ts)
- The assistant initialization and uploading of data is in
  [`convex/init.ts`](./convex/init.ts)
- The public endpoints for the backend are in
  [`convex/messages.ts`](./convex/messages.ts)
- The answering logic is in [`convex/serve.ts`](./convex/serve.ts)

## Running the App

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will configure a Convex project if you don't already have one, open the
Convex dashboard and the web app running on `localhost`.

For the chat itself to work, you must configure the following environment
variables on the Convex dashboard:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set to an [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) API key
  (should start with `sk-`)
- `ASSISTANT_ID` set to the assitant ID, which you can get from the OpenAI
  dashboard or by running

  `npx convex run init:createAssistant`

# What is Convex?

[Convex](https://convex.dev) is a hosted backend platform with a built-in
database that lets you write your
[database schema](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas) and
[server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions) in
[TypeScript](https://docs.convex.dev/typescript). Server-side database
[queries](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) automatically
[cache](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#caching--reactivity)
and [subscribe](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#reactivity) to data,
powering a
[realtime `useQuery` hook](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react#fetching-data)
in our [React client](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react). There are also
[Python](https://docs.convex.dev/client/python),
[Rust](https://docs.convex.dev/client/rust),
[ReactNative](https://docs.convex.dev/client/react-native), and
[Node](https://docs.convex.dev/client/javascript) clients, as well as a
straightforward
[HTTP API](https://github.com/get-convex/convex-js/blob/main/src/browser/http_client.ts#L40).

The database support
[NoSQL-style documents](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-storage) with
[relationships](https://docs.convex.dev/database/document-ids) and
[custom indexes](https://docs.convex.dev/database/indexes/) (including on fields
in nested objects).

The [`query`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions) and
[`mutation`](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions) server
functions have transactional, low latency access to the database and leverage
our [`v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes) with
[determinism guardrails](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#using-randomness-and-time-in-queries-and-mutations)
to provide the strongest ACID guarantees on the market: immediate consistency,
serializable isolation, and automatic conflict resolution via
[optimistic multi-version concurrency control](https://docs.convex.dev/database/advanced/occ)
(OCC / MVCC).

The [`action` server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions) have
access to external APIs and enable other side-effects and non-determinism in
either our [optimized `v8` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes)
or a more
[flexible `node` runtime](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/runtimes#nodejs-runtime).

Functions can run in the background via
[scheduling](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/scheduled-functions) and
[cron jobs](https://docs.convex.dev/scheduling/cron-jobs).

Development is cloud-first, with
[hot reloads for server function](https://docs.convex.dev/cli#run-the-convex-dev-server)
editing via the [CLI](https://docs.convex.dev/cli). There is a
[dashbord UI](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard) to
[browse and edit data](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/data),
[edit environment variables](https://docs.convex.dev/production/environment-variables),
[view logs](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/logs),
[run server functions](https://docs.convex.dev/dashboard/deployments/functions),
and more.

There are built-in features for
[reactive pagination](https://docs.convex.dev/database/pagination),
[file storage](https://docs.convex.dev/file-storage),
[reactive search](https://docs.convex.dev/text-search),
[https endpoints](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/http-actions) (for
webhooks),
[streaming import/export](https://docs.convex.dev/database/import-export/), and
[runtime data validation](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#validators)
for [function arguments](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/args-validation) and
[database data](https://docs.convex.dev/database/schemas#schema-validation).

Everything scales automatically, and itâ€™s
[free to start](https://www.convex.dev/plans).
